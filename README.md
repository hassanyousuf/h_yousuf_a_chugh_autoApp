# AUTO BUILD

## Project Description:
The basis of this assignment is to create an interactive application using 3D, video, audio and still images. Design and develop an engaging experience for the end user with which they can view video, explore specs, etc for a car of your choice. 
This project will be a collaborative effort between the MMED-3001 class and MMED-1012 class. The assets you develop in MMED-3001 will be implemented, manipulated and controlled dynamically in the MMED-1012 class.

## Project Requirements:
* All 3D elements must be created in Cinema 4D – no exceptions. 
* Animation and timing are to be created by you. 
* Brand consistent animation of your chosen car 
* A final video rendered out in web ready .mp4 format 
* Video size for final demo reel render will be 1280 pixels wide by 720 pixels high, with 100% H.264 codec compression 

## Pass/Fail Grading Scheme:
* Pass/Fail Grading Scheme: Overall Accuracy, Design, Editing, Following Directions: 25 marks
* Split-Screen Animation/Video Look: 20 marks 
* Use of Object Buffers: 10 marks 
* Texturing: 10 marks Camera Angles: 10 marks 
* Lighting Setup: 10 marks 
* Timing to Music: 10 
* Batch Render Setting Set-up: 5 marks 

## Part 2

Each team will develop a responsive mobile-first application to showcase an interactive implementation of your design. Please note that this means that you can consider how the graphics and interactivity evolve as a web app. Start with a splash page with a “hero shot” - but use a video produced in 3001 instead. See the provided example as a reference. Include some UI elements for navigation - you’ll need to move from this page to an interactive “details” page that showcases selected features. The “details” page should also have controls to navigate and view product details.

## DESIGNER (Apurav): 
Create the look and feel of the application. Start at mobile, and evolve your design for tablet and desktop. You are responsible for prototyping the application with a tool of your choice (Adobe XD, InVision, etc). Your prototype will assist the developer to create interactive elements and how to access remote data (text, video clips, images, etc). Remember that you’ll need a few different videos / sizes depending on device.

## DEVELOPER (Hassan):
Create a repository on Github including a detailed Readme file. Put the appropriate information in the Readme file - you will likely have to update throughout the lifecycle of the project. 

## Features

* Interactive specs info
* 360 view of car
